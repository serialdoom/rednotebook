How to generate your own RedNotebook bundle
===========================================
(many thanks to Joshua Parsley for documenting this)

- Download and install WineBottler from http://winebottler.kronenberg.org
- Download the latest RedNotebook installer from http://rednotebook.sf.net
- Open WineBottler and click on the "Advanced" button at the top.
  (documentation: http://winebottler.kronenberg.org/documentation -> Do Your Own)
- Click "select File..." and choose the RedNotebook installer.
- Check "Bundle" to include Wine binaries so the bundle becomes portable
  and Wine doesn't have to be installed.
- Click "Install".
- Choose the location where you want to save the bundle.
- Follow the install prompts just as you would in Windows
  (always clicking "Next" is fine).
- Open the .app file.

Note: I would recommend saving the data files somewhere in the OSX
      filesystem rather than the default (within the Wine system).
      This makes the files easier to find from within OSX and it shouldn't
      change functionality.
